# framework2D
An old code base for making 2D games.

Currently a pet project to reacclimate myself with game development. 

# Build dependencies:
- DirectX 9 SDK (June 2010)
- Vulkan SDK
- GLM
- GLFW
- TinyXML2

The /bin folder contains free to use assets from anokolisa.itch.io.

If you reuse any of this code, please give a shout out or buy me a coffee for support. <3
